On Linux, procfs has a process map file that contains both a file descriptor number and a pathname
that corresponds to a chunk of a given process's mmap space.

FreeBSD4's /proc/curproc/map file does not have either.  This kernel module allows valgrind to identify
which file some random mmap segment came from or the filename that corresponds to a random fd.

This package works on both FreeBSD-4.x and 6.x.
